# Startup Slack Notification for Laravel
This package adds a command to send a "startup-notification" to slack to inform you when the server is started. This is useful during a deploy to get a notification when the deployment has been completed.

## Installation
Add the package to your Laravel project.

`composer require krisell/startup-slack-notification-laravel

The package is configured for automatic discovery, so unless you have other settings, you do not need to manually add the service provider.
